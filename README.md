# Vehicle Performance Prediction
Vehicle Performance prediction using Linear regression SGD method

## Abstract
Vehicle performance prediction has become an important area of research due to the growing concern for fuel efficiency and reducing carbon emissions. In order to optimize fuel consumption, it is necessary to predict the expected mileage of a vehicle based on various inputs. This information can then be used to optimize vehicle design, improve driving efficiency, and reduce environmental impact.

## Problem Statement
Analyse the different factors affecting the mileage of a vehicle and train a model using these features.

## SGD
Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is an optimization algorithm that can be used to find the best-fitting line for linear regression. The algorithm starts with an initial set of parameters for the line (such as the slope and y-intercept) and then iteratively updates them based on the negative gradient of the loss function with respect to the parameters. The vanilla stochastic gradient descent (SGD) updates weights by subtracting the current weight by a factor (i.e. Î±, the learning rate) of its gradient. The loss function measures the difference between the predicted values (based on the current parameter values) and the actual values.
